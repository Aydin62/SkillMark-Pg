# SkillMark SQL Portfolio

**SkillMark** is a structured SQL analytics showcase built on PostgreSQL 9.5+.
It demonstrates advanced querying, relational thinking, and analytics. 

It is organized across ***three conceptual tiers,*** from basic aggregation to full analytical pipelines using **window functions:**

- Tier 1 - Basic Aggregates (Using `GROUP BY`)

- Tier 2 - Join + Grouping

- Tier 3 - Window Functions

<br>

An overview of `SkillMark` structure is possible via the ERD:

## Purpose

This project serves as a **SQL mastery log** and a **portfolio-ready demonstration** of:

- relational data modeling
- aggregates and grouping
- multi-table joins
- window functions
- query design patterns for analytics
- ranking, moving averages, and score normalization

All queries are run against a mock **SkillMark Learning Management System** schema.
